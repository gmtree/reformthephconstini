          <p class="mt-3">In the peaceful “people power” revolt from February 22 to 25, 1986, tens of thousands of
unarmed Filipinos gathered to defend a small but swelling band of military rebels at the military
and police headquarters along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue that cuts through Metro Manila
from North to South. United in their cry for “Justice, Freedom and Democracy,” they peacefully
immobilized the armed forces of the 13-year Marcos dictatorship. On the fourth day they
banished the dictator into exile. Amazed at our extraordinary feat, the world applauded. Some
oppressed peoples in Eastern Europe and Asia took heart and followed our example to liberate
themselves from tyranny.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">In January 2001, not only at EDSA in Metro Manila but also in many cities, citizens
gathered and employed “people power” once more to bring down a president who was perceived
to be abusive and corrupt. Aggrieved citizens felt good once again but “people power” alone
could not bring us what we really need as a developing nation and democracy.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">The restoration of free elections and formal democracy under the 1987 Constitution has
not empowered citizens to check or mitigate our pervasive problems of mass poverty,
unemployment, corruption, social inequality, injustice, rebellion, and the environment.
Underdevelopment and population still force legions of Filipinos to migrate as our country lags
farther behind our advanced neighbors in the region.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">Despite its many positive features that are worth preserving, the 1987 Constitution has
not enabled us to rebuild our various institutions for good governance. We continued with our
counter-productive unitary system with its powers, authority and resources centralized in the
national government at the expense of local governments, leaders, citizens, and entrepreneurs
and country-wide development.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">We restored our adversarial separation of powers in a presidential system that continually
creates conflict and gridlock between the President and Congress, with a vengeance. Our
outmoded form of government and dysfunctional political parties sustain our politics of
personality, patronage, cronyism, and corruption and without transparency and public accountability.”</p>

          <p class="mt-3">&gt; &#34;One problem is the Philippines has an American-style constitution, one of the most difficult to operate in the world. There is a complete separation of powers between executive, legislature and judiciary.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">They wrote the constitution in 1787 and ratified it in 1789. They wanted a weak executive president. Having suffered at the hands of King George III of England, they wanted the opposite of a strong monarch. But a developing country faced with disorder and underdevelopment needs a strong honest government.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">A US-style constitution failed long before Marcos declared martial law. It was re-adopted in 1987 by President Aquino. The system worked in America because of a super-abundance of resources and riches in a vast under-populated continent. </p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">I do not believe that Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong or Singapore could have succeeded as they have done if they had to work under such a constitution, where gridlock on every major issue is a way of life. And you will notice that since the Vietnam War and the Great Society for some 28 years ago, the US system has not functioned even for the United States.&#34;</p>

          <p class="mt-3">&gt; &#34;Meanwhile, because of our over-centralization, our electoral system, the many faults of our constitutional structure, it could be said that in the Philippines we may not have a democracy as its best but we do have democracy at its hardest. Such a judgment, while critical of the system, is a tribute to the people. The important thing is that it is democracy and that it is working. And in the irrepressible optimism of the people and their deep--seated faith in the superiority of free enterprise lies a promise that here democracy will someday be at its best. Herein lies our claim to the understanding and support of free nations.&#34; (&#34;The State of Democracy&#34;, 624)</p>

          <p class="mt-3">&gt; &#34;Our Constitution was frankly an imitation of the American charter. Many of the delegates were products of an American system of education and consequently were obsessed with the sincere belief that Democracy can be defined only in American terms. Necessarily, therefore, the Philippine presidency became a copy of the American presidency, with its vast concentration of powers and only periodical accountability to the people. Like the man in the White House, the man in Malacañang is now safe from immediate responsibility. And like the men on Capitol Hill, the men on Taft and Lepanto (the old Congress) do not have to render accounts for the fixed limits of their terms. A bad President and a bad Congress may not, in Lincoln&#39;s phrase, fool all the people all of the time. But they can make fools of the people – they can make fools of themselves – for at least four years...&#34;</p>

Don&#39;t go saying that what happened to the small American republics will happen to us. They easily won their independence, and their inhabitants are animated by a different spirit from that of the Filipinos. In addition, the danger of falling into other hands, English or German, for example, will force them to be sensible and prudent. The not great preponderance of any one race over the others will drive away from the imagination all mad ambition to dominate, and as the tendency of tyrannized countries, once they shake off the yoke, is to adopt the freest government, like a boy leaving school. , like the swing of the pendulum, by a law of reaction the Islands will probably declare themselves a federal Republic....”</p>
