          <p class="mt-3">(October 10) 'Our long-ailing political party system finally died this week. Instead of party politics, all we have now is celebrity/dynastic politics. This will not serve the nation well.</p>
		  
		  <p class="mt-3">It was a long, painful process of death. It began after the nation was put under martial law in 1972 and elections became highly controlled exercises. Organized party engagement in elections never recovered from this.</p>
		  
		  <p class="mt-3">In 1987, a Constitution was hurriedly written and quickly passed in plebiscite. That vital document originally intended a shift to a unicameral parliamentary system. It provided for a multi-party system resembling the European pattern of representation.</p>
		  
		  <p class="mt-3">At the last moment, one swing vote shifted the form of government back to a US-style presidential system. Given the rush to bring a new Constitution into place, all the provisions in the document suited for a parliamentary government were left unaltered. This is the reason we continue to quarrel over whether the two chambers of Congress vote jointly or separately over proposed amendments.</p>
		  
		  <p class="mt-3">Over the years, we battled over the strange party-list system embedded in the Constitution and failed to enact any legislation that would ban political dynasties. We were never sure if the party-list system intended to amplify political party representation or ensure minority ideological factions survive. We never arrived at a common understanding about what “sectoral representation” meant.</p>
		  
		  <p class="mt-3">What we did adopt was term limits. There is no final judgment on whether this works better for our democracy. It arbitrarily limits the tenure in elective office of competent officials. Even as it does, it encouraged whole families to enter electoral politics to substitute each other to defy the intentions of term limits.'</p>

		  <p class="mt-3">"Book description. The US occupation of the Philippine Islands in 1898 began a foundational period of the modern Philippine state. With the adoption of the 1935 Philippine Constitution, the legal conventions for ultimate independence were in place. In this time, American officials and their Filipino elite collaborators established a representative, progressive, yet limited colonial government that would modernize the Philippine Islands through colonial democracy and developmental capitalism. Examining constitutional discourse in American and Philippine government records, academic literature, newspaper and personal accounts, The Foundations of the Modern Philippine State concludes that the promise of America's liberal empire was negated by the imperative of insulating American authority from Filipino political demands. Premised on Filipino incapacity, the colonial constitution weakened the safeguards that shielded liberty from power and unleashed liberalism's latent tyrannical potential in the name of civilization. This forged a constitutional despotism that haunts the Islands to this day."</p>

          <p class="mt-3">&gt; “I. With EDSA 1 we restored an outmoded form of democracy.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">In the peaceful “people power” revolt from February 22 to 25, 1986, tens of thousands of
unarmed Filipinos gathered to defend a small but swelling band of military rebels at the military
and police headquarters along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue that cuts through Metro Manila
from North to South. United in their cry for “Justice, Freedom and Democracy,” they peacefully
immobilized the armed forces of the 13-year Marcos dictatorship. On the fourth day they
banished the dictator into exile. Amazed at our extraordinary feat, the world applauded. Some
oppressed peoples in Eastern Europe and Asia took heart and followed our example to liberate
themselves from tyranny.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">In January 2001, not only at EDSA in Metro Manila but also in many cities, citizens
gathered and employed “people power” once more to bring down a president who was perceived
to be abusive and corrupt. Aggrieved citizens felt good once again but “people power” alone
could not bring us what we really need as a developing nation and democracy.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">The restoration of free elections and formal democracy under the 1987 Constitution has
not empowered citizens to check or mitigate our pervasive problems of mass poverty,
unemployment, corruption, social inequality, injustice, rebellion, and the environment.
Underdevelopment and population still force legions of Filipinos to migrate as our country lags
farther behind our advanced neighbors in the region.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">Despite its many positive features that are worth preserving, the 1987 Constitution has
not enabled us to rebuild our various institutions for good governance. We continued with our
counter-productive unitary system with its powers, authority and resources centralized in the
national government at the expense of local governments, leaders, citizens, and entrepreneurs
and country-wide development.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">We restored our adversarial separation of powers in a presidential system that continually
creates conflict and gridlock between the President and Congress, with a vengeance. Our
outmoded form of government and dysfunctional political parties sustain our politics of
personality, patronage, cronyism, and corruption and without transparency and public accountability.”</p>

          <p class="mt-3">They wrote the constitution in 1787 and ratified it in 1789. They wanted a weak executive president. Having suffered at the hands of King George III of England, they wanted the opposite of a strong monarch. But a developing country faced with disorder and underdevelopment needs a strong honest government.</p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">A US-style constitution failed long before Marcos declared martial law. It was re-adopted in 1987 by President Aquino. The system worked in America because of a super-abundance of resources and riches in a vast under-populated continent. </p>
          
          <p class="mt-3">I do not believe that Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong or Singapore could have succeeded as they have done if they had to work under such a constitution, where gridlock on every major issue is a way of life.

          <p class="mt-3">&gt; &#34;Our Constitution was frankly an imitation of the American charter. Many of the delegates were products of an American system of education and consequently were obsessed with the sincere belief that Democracy can be defined only in American terms. Necessarily, therefore, the Philippine presidency became a copy of the American presidency, with its vast concentration of powers and only periodical accountability to the people. Like the man in the White House, the man in Malacañang is now safe from immediate responsibility. And like the men on Capitol Hill, the men on Taft and Lepanto (the old Congress) do not have to render accounts for the fixed limits of their terms. A bad President and a bad Congress may not, in Lincoln&#39;s phrase, fool all the people all of the time.
